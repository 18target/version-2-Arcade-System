# version-2-Arcade-System // Game Hub Version 2!!!!

the first one was my first eer trial project on java,

 this is no differen but at least i'm improving myself, thats some bonus point. in the future i'll have to upgrade and work on this till it is fully functional. let me first finish these coming exams.


 Open ONLY the ARCADE.JAVA file. DO NOT open the APP.JAVA file,=> it just contains hello world code snippet.

 The ARCADE.JAVA is the one which contains the GUI for this system. enjoy
